# **Line Draw**  *v0.0.1 - Unreleased*
## **First C++ Program & Initial Test For OpenFrameworks**
#### *Move your mouse around, it will effect the movement of the line*

______________________________

Decided to get OpenFrameworks to help me learn C++ along with the ability to connect to USB peripherals, webcam, among many other things.

So, this is my first compiled program!

I'm storing some point positions, then drawing multi colored triangles between neighboring points to create a trippy trail!
